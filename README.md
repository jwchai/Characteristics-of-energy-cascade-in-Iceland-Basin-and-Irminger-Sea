# Characteristics of Energy Cascade in Iceland Basin and Irminger Sea

This repository contains all MATLAB scripts and data visualization code used in the study **"Characteristics of energy cascade in Iceland Basin and Irminger Sea"**.

The analysis is based on SADCP-derived velocity fields and focuses on seasonal and spatial variability of kinetic energy (KE) cascades in the subpolar North Atlantic.
